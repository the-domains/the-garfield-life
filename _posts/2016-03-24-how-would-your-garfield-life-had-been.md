How would your Garfield Life had been?

If you were not stuck up in your shitty job 5 or 7 days a week and if you had an alternative, how would your life had been?

Would you be watching movies all the time?

Would you have been playing soccer?

Would you have been reading books all the time or listening to music?

Writing poems and books?

Anything else?
